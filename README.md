# ![Empire logo](EMPIRE_LOGO.png) Platform API

Open-API specification for the REST API of Empire allocation and nomination platform of BritNed.

The common Open-API specification ( single YAML file) is available in the root of this repository. The recommended exploration of the options is to use the web-based navigation through it at [https://britned.github.io/empire-platform-api](https://britned.github.io/empire-platform-api)

## Notes for developers
- The YAML specification will be updated with the URLs of the platform where you can access it, when the URL is decided on. (This will hence be a new version/release)
- Usage of our API is subject to our [Terms of Use](API%20terms%20of%20use%20for%20EMPIRE%20by%20participants%20-%20v1.pdf), of which you find a PDF on this repository and a link on our website.
